Project has been setup using Maven and Serenity as base framework.
To run the execution setup the project as Maven project and run the command "mvn verify".
Reports get generated under target->site->serenity.


Project can be enhanced in various ways to name few:


1) Build a test base class with all the action methods wrapped in try catch blocks.
2) Setup a better synchronisation of the selenium and the web application.

I will be happy to discuss this further

Please let me know if you have any questions.
